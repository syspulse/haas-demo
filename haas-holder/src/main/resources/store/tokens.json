Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network."},"links":{"homepage":["https://ens.domains/","https://app.ens.domains/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://discuss.ens.domains/","",""],"chat_url":["https://chat.ens.domains/","",""],"announcement_url":["https://ens.mirror.xyz/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ensdomains","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/thumb/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/small/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/large/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":85.71,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":14.29,"market_cap_rank":112,"coingecko_rank":476,"coingecko_score":28.636,"developer_score":0.0,"community_score":10.783,"liquidity_score":57.472,"public_interest_score":0.071,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2022-09-20T02:00:20.252Z"}

Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM’s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\r\n\r\nFOAM Token Functionality\r\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\r\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\r\n\r\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\r\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\r\n\r\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\r\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes’ clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph, this ‘Dynamic Proof of Location’ is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace’s control."},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.foam.space/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x4946fcea7c692606e8908002e55a582af44ac121","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4946fcea7c692606e8908002e55a582af44ac121","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["http://discourse.foam.space","",""],"chat_url":["https://gitter.im/f-o-a-m/","",""],"announcement_url":["https://t.me/Foamprotocol",""],"twitter_screen_name":"foamspace","facebook_username":"foamprotocol","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"foamspace","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/foamprotocol/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/f-o-a-m/","https://github.com/f-o-a-m/plasma-demo","https://github.com/f-o-a-m/foam.css"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/thumb/K51lJQc.png?1547037959","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/small/K51lJQc.png?1547037959","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/large/K51lJQc.png?1547037959"},"country_origin":"US","genesis_date":"2018-07-28","contract_address":"0x4946fcea7c692606e8908002e55a582af44ac121","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2018-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2018-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"Open Protocol for Proof of Location on Ethereum","description":null,"links":{},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"USD","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":"24000000.0","total_raised":"16548796.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1.0,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.05516,"accepting_currencies":"ETH","country_origin":"US","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"https://tokenfoundry.com/projects/foam","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":"300000000.0","kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":true,"pre_sale_available":false,"pre_sale_ended":false},"market_cap_rank":945,"coingecko_rank":1531,"coingecko_score":18.398,"developer_score":0.0,"community_score":28.483,"liquidity_score":1.0,"public_interest_score":0.0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":357516,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[{"description":"Agenda and sign-up form below for the next FOAM Community Workshop Call (#4), on Thursday, August 22nd @ 12pm EDT.\r\n\r\nTopics- FOAM Improvement Proposal Process \u0026 Spec Finalization and Open Discussion Forum \r\n\r\nhttps://discourse.foam.space/t/8-22-community-workshop-iv-fips-and-open-forum/1009","category":"general","created_at":"2019-08-18T23:00:12.788Z","user":"Daryl Lau ","user_title":"Community Administrator","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"foam-protocol","name":"FOAM","symbol":"foam","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/thumb/K51lJQc.png?1547037959","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/small/K51lJQc.png?1547037959","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/large/K51lJQc.png?1547037959"}}},{"description":"The FOAMSpace team is excited to share that we have commenced work with the Interchain Foundation on a Haskell based SDK and production level ABCI servers for Cosmos and Tendermint opening new language options for developers ⚛️\r\n\r\nRead more here\r\nhttps://discourse.foam.space/t/foam-working-with-interchain-foundation-on-haskell-cosmos-sdk/926","category":"general","created_at":"2019-07-30T06:58:52.713Z","user":"Daryl Lau ","user_title":"Community Administrator","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"foam-protocol","name":"FOAM","symbol":"foam","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/thumb/K51lJQc.png?1547037959","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/small/K51lJQc.png?1547037959","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/large/K51lJQc.png?1547037959"}}},{"description":"The next community call will be on FOAM Location, focusing on our recent milestone of processing and validating a Presence Claim over radio with Plasma and Tendermint 🔮⚡️📻⛓️\r\n\r\nWe will be joined by Rick Dudley who has been invaluable for the development of FOAM Location with his additions and feedback.\r\n\r\n⏰ 9am PST -

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work.
